# Data-Visualization-and-Machine-Learning

• Explored and analyzed a dataset of Fraud and Non-Fraud Transactions to identify outliers, correlations, and extract meaningful insights.

• Preprocessed data by handling missing values and scaling for improved model performance.

• Developed and evaluated a machine learning model, saving the final model as a .pkl file.

• Designed and built an interactive dashboard with dynamic filters for real-time data visualization.

• Created a Flask API with two main functionalities:

   -Train: Executes the full machine learning pipeline and saves the trained model.
   
   -Predict: Utilizes the trained model to generate predictions on new input data.

This project highlights my ability to navigate the entire machine learning lifecycle, driving data exploration, model development, and real-time decision-making.
